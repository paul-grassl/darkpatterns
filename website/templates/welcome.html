            <h1>Welcome to the online study "First impression counts"</h1>
        </div>
        <p>This study is about the first impression of news websites in terms of their graphic design. First, you will be directed to
        several news websites (but only shown them for 3 seconds) and asked after each news website whether you think that the website looks appealing to you
        in terms of its layout and colouring (there is no right or wrong, we just want you first impression). After in total eight
        news websites you are directed back to the survey platform to answer a few more general questions. Then the study
        is finished and you will be redirected to SONA.
        </p>

        <p><i>Note: It is recommended to do the study on a PC/laptop/tablet instead of on a phone.</i></p>

        <p>The answers will be processed anonymously and the whole procedure takes about 10-15 minutes.</p>

        <p>Through the successful completion of the study, you have the opportunity to win a 20â‚¬ bol.com voucher (of ca. 30
        vouchers in total). After our data collection period (about 1 month) we will randomly select SONA IDs to determine
        the winners. In case you won we will contact you via <b>the phone number you provided in SONA</b> (please make sure it is correct!)
        to ask for your name and post address for reimbursement purposes of Radboud University.
        After receiving name and home address we will send you your bol.com voucher code (via SMS).
        </p>

        <p>Your name and post address CANNOT be linked to your answers in the study.</p>

        <p>This means we cannot inform you about your personal results after the survey has been completed, however, we
        could inform you about the results of the whole study.</p>

        <p>If you are interested in being informed about the results of this study, you can contact the researcher Paul Grassl
        (p.grassl@bsi.ru.nl)</p>

        <p>If, for any reason, you do not feel comfortable answering the questions you are free to leave the study at any point,
        without having to give any reason for it and without any consequence (participation is voluntary). If you have any further questions, you can
        contact the researcher (through the email address provided above).
